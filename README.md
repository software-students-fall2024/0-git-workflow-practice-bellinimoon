# Git Practice
[This article](https://blog.bradfieldcs.com/you-are-not-google-84912cf44afb) talks about how you shouldn't put into use some fancy technology directly, but rather should decide whether the technology is the right fit for your problem and use it only when it is.

I've never really considered this before. The last time I did need to use some sort of library from the internet, I used the first one that appeared on the search engine and was described as easy to use.

I think the article is a great reminder for me.
